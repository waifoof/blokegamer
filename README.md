###The Blokes Mods###

This repository is merely just so I can house the different mods I make for different games, whatever they may be.
They're generally just for fun so I can learn modding and usually involve me putting variations of myself & mates into games


The current games that have been modded are:

*Baldur's Gate 2 (Original) works with the BGT mod too so this includes Baldur's Gate 1

*Neverwinter Nights

*Lethal Company

*Persona 4 Golden 32-Bit
